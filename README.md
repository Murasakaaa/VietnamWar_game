# VietnamWar_game
A friend and I made a tiny game with Godot for school in just two weeks. We had to create something related to the Vietnam War and it could be anything so I proposed the idea of making a game to my friend. We never used Godot before so it was the perfect opportunity to try it.
We didn't have much time and we had the final exam coming soon so the game is still a bit buggy but it was enough to present it in class. I even made a small trailer for it.
